    \class QCanvasPainterItemRenderer
    \since 6.11
    \brief The QCanvasPainterItemRenderer handles all painting for a QCanvasPainterItem.
    \inmodule QtCanvasPainter

    Implement the paint() method to perform the rendering.

    To expose data from the item to the renderer in a thread-safe manner,
    implement synchronize().

    The renderer object lives and operates on the \l {Scene Graph and
    Rendering}{Qt Quick scene graph render thread}, if there is one, since that
    is the thread on which \l{QCanvasPainterItem::}{createItemRenderer()} and
    all the functions in this class are invoked.

    If the QCanvasPainterItem is moved to a different \l{QQuickWindow}{window},
    it will get associated with a new \l QRhi. Therefore, the renderer object is
    automatically destroyed, and a new one is created by invoking
    \l{QCanvasPainterItem::}{createItemRenderer()} again. This allows simple
    management of QCanvasImage and QCanvasOffscreenCanvas objects, because they can be
    member variables in renderer, set up either in initializeResources() or in
    paint(), without having to reset them when the graphics resources are lost
    due to the window and QRhi change, since it all happens implicitly by the
    destruction of the whole renderer object.

    The below code snippet shows the typical structure of a
    QCanvasPainterItemRenderer subclass. See QCanvasPainterItem for an example of
    the \c MyItem class.
